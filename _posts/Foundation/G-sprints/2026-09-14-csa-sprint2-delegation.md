title: "CSA Sprint 2: who teaches what"
description: Each table teaches the part of OCS it builds. This page lists the proposed topics and days, why each topic belongs to its table, and how to change the plan.

## The rule

Teach what you build. The teacher's CSA topic list on [/sprint2/objectives](/sprint2/objectives) names the systems the CSA tables are building right now: the chat, the login, the submission and grading pipeline, the AI grader, the design system. A table that teaches its own system can show real code, answer hard questions, and point at a running page.

The plan lives in `_data/teaching_plan/csa.yml`. This page explains it. The calendar draws it.

## Proposed lessons

Every row below is a proposal. The teacher and the tables confirm or change them by pull request. Dates are school days in weeks 6 and 7; 2026-09-29 is a non-student day.

| Day | Topic | Table | Why this table |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tue 09-22 | Chat and WebSockets | UGRC | They built the course chat: announcements, week threads, direct messages. |
| Wed 09-23 | API, MVC, and security systems | UGRC | They host the backend on AWS and own the Groups management page. |
| Thu 09-24 | Roles in submitting, teaching, and grading | AAA | They build who may create an assignment and who may grade it. |
| Fri 09-25 | AI pipeline in grading | Compute-Cuties | They built the AI autograder: a rubric per assignment and a Gemini call that scores against it. |
| Wed 09-30 | JWT login and cookies | Admin table | They own login: password reset, password rules, rate limits. |
| Thu 10-01 | Designing SASS utilities and runners similar to Tailwind class definitions | UGRC | The OCS design system: tokens, fifteen components, a docs page. |

## Checkpoints for everyone

From the teacher's sample weeks:

| Day | Checkpoint |
|---|---|
| Mon 09-21 | Checkpoint on Lesson PRs |
| Wed 09-23 | Create HW and Grading Stats |
| Mon 09-28 | Checkpoint and Lesson Grades · Update HW and Grading Stats |
| Wed 09-30 | Update HW and Grading Stats |
| Fri 10-02 | Complete and Submit HW and Grading Stats |

## Not placed yet

Topics from the teacher's list with no table: AWS S3 uploads · Custom JPA queries · Game state tracking: quick and persistent · AI pipeline in gaming and state persistence.

Teams with no slot yet: UGRC's direct-messages team (Perry, Syowns, Leon) · AAA's Analytics and Self Assessment team (Katherine, Jacob, Bridget) · AAA's AI Grading team (Nicolas Diaz, William Windle, Rishabh Jha).

Two of those fit together. The direct-messages team wrote custom JPA queries for conversations, so "Custom JPA queries" could be theirs. AAA's AI Grading team and Compute-Cuties both work on AI grading, so they could teach "AI pipeline in grading" together or split it: the pipeline on one day, the rubric on another. Both are suggestions, not decisions.

## How to claim or change a slot

1. Open `_data/teaching_plan/csa.yml` on GitHub and click the pencil.
2. Add or edit your row. The README next to the file explains every key.
3. Propose the change. That opens a pull request.

Before 4:00 PM the day before a lesson, this is the way. On the day itself, post the change in that week's chat on the course page.

## What a lesson needs

Copy the [lesson template](/sprint2/teaching-lesson-template). It has the frontmatter the site needs and every required section: learning objective, success criteria, LxD notes, Tech Talk, popcorn hack, homework hack, grading plan, revision log.
